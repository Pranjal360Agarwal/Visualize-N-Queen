## Introduction

The N-Queen problem is a classic example of a constraint satisfaction problem in computer science and artificial intelligence. It involves placing N queens on an N x N chessboard such that no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal. This visualizer helps users see the different solutions and understand the problem-solving process.
